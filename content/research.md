#### Nonparametric Testability of Slutsky Symmetry (with Florian Gunsilius) — Under Review  
**Authors:** Florian Gunsilius, Lonjezo Sithole

**Abstract.** 
Economic theory implies strong limitations on what types of consumption behavior are considered rational. Rationality implies that the Slutsky matrix, which captures the substitution effects of compensated price changes on demand for different goods, is symmetric and negative semi-definite. While empirically informed versions of negative semi-definiteness have been shown to be nonparametrically testable, the analogous question for Slutsky symmetry has remained open.
Recently, it has even been shown that the symmetry condition is not testable via the average Slutsky matrix, prompting conjectures about its non-testability. We settle this question by deriving nonparametric conditional quantile restrictions on observable data that permit construction of a fully nonparametric test for Slutsky symmetry in an empirical setting with individual heterogeneity and endogeneity.
The theoretical contribution is a multivariate generalization of identification results for partial effects in nonseparable models without monotonicity, which is of independent interest. This result has implications for different areas in econometric theory, including nonparametric welfare analysis with individual heterogeneity for which, in the case of more than two goods, the symmetry condition introduces a nonlinear correction factor.

#### A Locally Robust Semiparametric Approach to Examiner IV Designs — Draft  
**Author:** Lonjezo Sithole  
[PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19144)

**Abstract.** 
I propose a locally robust semiparametric framework for estimating causal effects using the popular examiner IV design, in the presence of many examiners and possibly many covariates relative to the sample size. The key ingredient of this approach is an orthogonal moment function that is robust to biases and local misspecification from the first step estimation of the examiner IV.
I derive the orthogonal moment function and show that it delivers multiple robustness where the outcome model or at least one of the first step components is misspecified but the estimating equation remains valid.
The proposed framework not only allows for estimation of the examiner IV in the presence of many examiners and many covariates relative to sample size, using a wide range of nonparametric and machine learning techniques including LASSO, Dantzig, neural networks and random forests, but also delivers root-n consistent estimation of the parameter of interest under mild assumptions.
